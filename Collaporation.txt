1.Forking and pull requests
Forking and pull requests is the most common way to collaborate on GitHub. 
It involves creating a copy of a repository (a fork) on your own account,
 making changes to the fork, and then submitting those changes to the original repository as a pull request.


2. Branch-based collaboration
Branch-based collaboration is when developers work on different branches of a repository and
 then merge their changes together once they are ready.
